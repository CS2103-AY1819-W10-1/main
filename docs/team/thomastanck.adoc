README is a desktop bookmark manager/rss feed reader application.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *support for offline mode*
** What it does: allows the user to continue using the application even while offline.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because being able to read articles offline allows users to read more seamlessly while also being a selling point that other competing products do not support.
** Highlights: This enhancement needed to support saving many possibly large articles on the disk without keeping them in memory. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands as well as a large scale refactor of the architecture itself.
