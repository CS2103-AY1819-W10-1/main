Hello! I am Rayner Lim, a Computer Science student at the National University of Singapore.
I design and code, and am passionate about building great products, services & systems.
Here you can find my contributions to one of my projects.

== PROJECT: README

== Overview

My team and I were tasked with enhancing a basic address book desktop application with a command line interface (CLI) for our Software Engineering project.
We decided to morph it into an integrated bookmark manager and web feed aggregator called README.

This product helps heavy web content consumers read more productively, efficiently and comfortably by keeping everything they want to read in one place,
with powerful organization options, offline support, web feed aggregation and a reading view mode as key features.

Users interact with it using a command line interface (CLI), and it has a graphical user interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10,000 lines of code.

My role was to design and implement the Reader View feature, which gives users a better reading experience, as well as the user interface (UI).
The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant sections I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: I added the *Reader View* feature
** What it does: The *Reader View* provides a clean, minimalist reading experience by stripping out all the visual clutter from web pages and presents content in a perfectly formatted, clean layout, with user-selectable colour schemes.
** Justification: This feature improves the user experience significantly because it lets users focus on consuming content without any unnecessary distractions and helps them read more comfortably, thus improving productivity.
** Highlights: This enhancement required analysis of design alternatives to open it up for usage in as many scenarios as possible. The implementation was challenging as it required managing complex state. It also required an in-depth understanding of the JavaFX WebView component, as well as knowledge of the HTML Document Object Model and CSS styling.
** Credits: The https://github.com/dankito/Readability4J[Readability4J] library does the heavy lifting of extracting a web pageâ€˜s relevant content and removing clutter from it. I used the https://jsoup.org/[Jsoup] library to extract additional useful metadata, and combined this with the results from Readability4J into a new web page, where I used the https://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap] framework to layout content and adapted the https://bootswatch.com/litera/[Bootswatch Litera] theme into different colour schemes for presenting content.

* *Minor enhancement*: I added a navigation sidebar UI component that helps users create a mental model of the app structure,
and also offers convenient access to the major areas of the app.
This required modifying the existing design to decouple displaying of command results from user-entered commands.
It also supports asynchronous commands in future that can return an initial result first, do some long-running work, and then return another final result.

* *Minor enhancement*: I added an autofill utility that lets users specify just a link when adding a new entry and have the title and description fields automatically filled.
This makes adding links to our appvery convenient for users.
