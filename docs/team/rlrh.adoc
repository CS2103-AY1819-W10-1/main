== PROJECT: README

---

== Overview

README is a desktop integrated bookmark manager and web feed reader application.
Users interact with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the *Reader View* feature
** What it does: Strips out all the visual clutter from web pages and presents content in a perfectly formatted, clean layout, with user-selectable colour schemes
** Justification: This feature improves the user experience significantly because users can focus on the content without any unnecessary distractions and read more comfortably.
** Highlights: This enhancement is designed to be used by many other commands. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives to enable this. The implementation was challenging as it required understanding exactly how the JavaFX WebView works.
** Credits: Jsoup, Readability4J

* *Minor enhancement*: added an autofill utility that lets users specify just a link when adding a new entry and have the title and description fields automatically filled.
