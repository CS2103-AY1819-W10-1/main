== PROJECT: README

== Overview

README is a desktop bookmark manager/rss feed reader application.

== Summary of contributions

=== *Major enhancement*: Entry management system
** What it does: A collection of several commands that allow users to manage a large number of entries in the entrybook.
** Justification: Essential for heavy users so that they can navigate large numbers of entries efficiently, and allows
them to partition their entries into groups using tags and the archive.
** Highlights:
*** Find command: Users can search for links in the list of currently displayed entries using any of the fields and/or tags.
*** Archives command: Users can archive links they have read.
*** Context switching: Users can make the application display different entries (archive entries, search result entries etc.)
via context-switching commands.

=== *Minor enhancement*: Morphing addressbook to entrybook
** Significantly contributed to refactors and renames of codebase to fit the context of our application.
