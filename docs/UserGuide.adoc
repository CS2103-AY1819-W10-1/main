== Introduction

README is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing links*.
More importantly, README is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, README can get your link management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started.
Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `README.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your README.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Try these commands in order!

* *`list`* : lists all saved links
* **`select`**`1` : select the first link displayed for reading
* **`read`**`1` : marks the 1st link as read
* **`delete`**`2` : deletes the 2nd link
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Or these commands, if you have internet access!

* **`search`**`Trump` : searches online for links related to keyword 'Trump'.
* **`add`**`1` : adds the first link displayed to the reading list
* *`list`* : lists all saved links, including the newly added one
* *`exit`* : exits the app
