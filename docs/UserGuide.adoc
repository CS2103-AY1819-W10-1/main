== Introduction
README is an integrated bookmark manager and feed reader desktop application
that helps you read more content you care about anywhere you go.

You'll love README if you consume a lot of web content and want to keep up to date with your favourite websites but you're a road warrior who doesn't have regular Internet access.

Whether you're heading off on a long flight or working in a cafe, README has you covered with all the content you care about in one place.

README is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for subscribing to web feeds and saving web pages to read later on their personal computer*.

More importantly, README is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, README can make you more efficient at consuming content than traditional GUI apps.

Enjoy!
