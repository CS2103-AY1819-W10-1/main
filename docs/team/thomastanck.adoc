= Thomas Tan - Project Portfolio

Good day!
I am a Computer Science undergraduate
at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
This document showcases the contributions I made for a group term project.
I hope this shows you my abilities engineering software!

== PROJECT: README

== Overview

README is a desktop bookmark manager/RSS feed reader application.
README lets users store webpages for offline reading,
in addition to subscribing to feeds
so that their favourite content is automatically downloaded and delivered to them.

When looking at many other applications on the market for inspiration,
we found a big hole.
Most other applications do not support reading your saved links while offline,
and as such we decided it was a critical feature,
and I was placed in charge of this feature.
However, this requires integrating `Storage` and `Network` together,
which lie on opposite ends of the design.
This makes it a technically challenging feature,
interacting with most other components such as the `Model`.

Thus, the bulk of my contributions lie in figuring out
a good way to architect the overall design
so that it is easy to support this feature.

== Summary of contributions

|===
|_Given below are contributions that I made to this application._
|===

=== *Major enhancement*: Offline mode

I implemented a local data store that stores articles so that they can be retrieved later even while offline.

** Justification: Dramatically makes the application more useful
                  for users who are often on the go,
                  without an internet connection.
** Highlights:
*** Automatic download: A copy of every article saved to the reading list
                        is saved so it can be viewed offline.
*** Refresh command: When pages get out of date,
                     the user can execute a command
                     to download an updated copy.
*** Absolute link conversion: Ensures most pages will continue to work properly
                              even while offline by converting relative links
                              that stop working when viewing pages offline,
                              to absolute links that work everywhere.

==== *Minor enhancement*: Adding `all` variants of commands

Many commands like `refresh` and `archive` (by Jonathan)
only operate on single entries.
I added new commands such as `refreshall` and `archiveall`
that operate on all currently displayed entries for ease of use.
