By: `CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-1`      Since: `Jan 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EntryListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

// tag::designlogic[]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `EntryBookParser` has several children classes that represent parsers for a specific context.
.  `Logic` uses the `EntryBookParser` children classes to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an entry).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
// end::designlogic[]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Entry>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Entry` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Entry` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
// tag::storagecomponent[]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="600"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects, and `EntryBook` data (for Reading List, Archives, and Feeds) in json format and read it back.
* can save .html articles in a data directory as individual files. The article contents are only read when required by the user.

Unlike the `UserPref` and `EntryBook` data, we don't store the articles in a flat file.
This is because the file size of the article store is much larger than the file sizes of all the prefs and reading list/archives/etc. combined,
so having it in a flat file would drastically slow down the application.

Instead, the files are saved to disk and are not read until the user clicks on an entry and wants to view it offline.

// end::storagecomponent[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::contextswitching[]
=== Context-specific commands

==== Current implementation

In order to implement the multiple commands for the application, we require
a way to disallow certain commands in certain contexts.

.Activity diagram for command execution
image::ContextSpecificCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

For example, when the user is viewing the archives, commands he enter are parsed in the "Archive context" as shown above.
If he enters the `archive` command, it will not be recognised as a valid command since every entry shown is already archived.

When a user is uses the `list` command, he switches to the "List context".
Now, when he enters the `archive` command with valid arguments, it is successfully executed.
However, the `unarchive` command will now not be recognised.


This presents two main problems; the need for separate command parsers for each context,
and a way for the application to keep track of its context.

==== Current Implementation

===== Modular Parser classes

We require individual Parser classes for each context.
Each Parser class should only parse commands allowed for the context it represents.

The following classes were created to support this feature (refer to the class diagram given below).

* `EntryBookParser` — the base abstract class all Parsers extend from.
* `EntryBookListParser` — Parser for the list context.
* `EntryBookArchivesParser` —  Parser for the archives context.
* `EntryBookFeedsParser` —  Parser for the feeds context.
* `EntryBookSearchParser` —  Parser for the search context.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component with parser classes.
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

Each Parser class has a `parseCommand(String)` operation that parses the string command.
`EntryBookParser#parseCommand(String)` is the fallback operation used when any of its children
fail to parse the command. It successfully parses commands that is common in any context (e.g. `exit`, `help`).

===== Context state for Model

Context is represented by the enum class `ModelContext`.
`Model` to holds this information of the context the application is in, which decides
Parser class `Logic` should use when a command is executed.
Each `ModelContext` holds a static Parser class that parses commands for the context it represents.

The following operations are implemented.

* `Model#getContext()` — gets the context the application is in.
* `Model#setContext(ModelContext)` — sets the context the application is in.

`Model#setContext(ModelContext)` is called when a context-switching command is executed
(refer to the <<UserGuide.adoc#Context-switch, User Guide>> for the list of these commands).

Given below is the sequence diagram for the context-switching command, `archives`.

.Sequence diagram for the `archives` command.
image::ChangeContextSdForModel.png[width="800"]

1.  The user launches the application.
2.  The `ModelManager` will default to `ModelContext.CONTEXT_LIST` context.
3.  The user enters the `archives` command.
4.  The current context, `ModelContext.CONTEXT_LIST`, is retrieved from the `ModelManager`.
5.  Static parser class `EntryBookListParser` in the `ModelContext.CONTEXT_LIST` is used to parse the command.
6.  Command is parsed successfully, and `ArchivesCommand` created.
7.  When the command is executed, context in `ModelManager` is set to `ModelContext.CONTEXT_ARCHIVES`.
8.  This triggers the `ModelManager` to display the `EntryBook` for the archives, via listeners.

==== Design Considerations
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Context information is held by `Model`
** Pros: makes the most sense for the context to change only if a context-switching command
is successfully executed, and `Command` only has a reference to `Model`, not `Logic`.
** Cons: `Model` is slightly more dependent on `Logic` since it has an indirect reference
to Parser classes. This causes more coupling.
* *Alternative 2:* Context information is held by `Logic`
** Pros: weakens the dependency of `Model` on `Logic`. Context can then be thought of as a
state for the `Logic` module, which is also responsible for parsing commands.
** Cons: making this work will involve architectural changes since only the `UI` module has
a reference to `Logic` module class (Parser).

Ultimately, Alternative 1 was chosen because we later decided that context should have a one-to-one
correspondence to which entrybook to display to the user (refer to <<Multiple-EntryBooks>>),
in addition to being the option which required the least modification to the rest
of the code base to implement.
// end::contextswitching[]

// tag::autofill[]
=== Autofill missing title or description when adding a link

When adding a link using the `add` command, users only need to specify the `URL` field.
If the `Title` or `Description` field is not specified, they are automatically filled.
This makes adding links much faster and more convenient for users.

==== Current Implementation

Autofill-related code lies in the `EntryAutofill` utility class.
The constructor takes in the original `Title` and `Description`,
and there are methods to parse URL and HTML in order to extract replacement candidates,
as well as to get the best `Title` and `Description` candidates.

The fallback is a default `Title` and `Description` guaranteed to work.
The first attempt to find replacement candidates is by parsing just the URL.
This will work even if there is no Internet access, whereas the following attempts require Internet access.
The next attempt is by using the Jsoup library to parse the raw HTML into a Document object and obtain information likely to be present,
and the last attempt is by using the Readability4J library to process the Document object and extract metadata.
In this way, the last successful attempt to replace `Title` and `Description` becomes their current best replacement candidate.
Since we cascade from the last choice to the first choice for `Title` and `Description` separately,
by the end we have found the best possible replacement candidate for each of them given the circumstances.
However, replacement candidates are only chosen if the original `Title` and `Description` are empty,
so the original user input is still the first choice, followed by the best replacement candidates found.

This means that if both `Title` and `Description` are already specified by the user, `AddCommand` just adds the `Entry` to the `Model`.
Otherwise, `AddCommand` attempts to find replacement candidates for a missing `Title` or `Description` heuristically,
then updates the `Entry` with the best replacement and adds it to the `Model`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Where autofill should be carried out

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** In `AddCommand`
** Pros: The pattern of keeping logic within `Command` is followed by containing autofill logic within `AddCommand`.
** Cons: Autofill only works for links added through `AddCommand`.
* **Alternative 2:** In `Model`
** Pros: Autofill can work for any link added to `Model`.
** Cons: The clean `Model` is polluted by including non-core logic like autofill.
* **Why current choice:**
** It is more important to follow the existing design conventions since it is not hard to include autofill logic in other areas using the `EntryAutofill` utility class.

===== Aspect: How replacement candidates should be cascaded

* **Alternative 1:** Check candidates are non-null and non-empty before replacing best candidate so far directly within `EntryAutofill` methods
** Pros: Simple to implement.
** Cons: Messy and hard-to-read code.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Create and use a new `Candidate` class that generalizes this idea to any type and any function that checks for candidate validity
** Pros: Can be reused in many places, more elegant code.
** Cons: Abstraction may be unnecessary.
* **Why current choice:**
** It is not hard to implement the `Candidate` class and the semantic beauty and elegance it affords is worth the small extra effort.
// end::autofill[]

// tag::readerview[]
=== Reader view mode

The reader view gives users a more focused reading experience by removing clutter and formatting content into a clean and easy-to-read layout.
Letting users choose a colour scheme that fits their lighting environment also makes their reading experience more comfortable.

Using the `view` command, users can switch between the `browser` and `reader` view modes, as well as choose a colour scheme using the optional `s/STYLE` parameter.

==== Current Implementation

Available view types are specified in the `ViewType` enum, and available reader view styles are specified in the `ReaderViewStyle` enum.
The `ViewMode` object encapsulates a `ViewType` and `ReaderViewStyle` and represents a user setting.
The `Model` exposes an observable `viewModeProperty`, which is set by `ViewModeCommand` and observed by `BrowserPanel`.

The `BrowserPanel` is a wrapper around the JavaFX `WebView` component, and is responsible for displaying web pages.
It keeps track of whether an internal page, offline page, online page or HTML content is loaded,
and reacts to events like changes in loading status, view mode and selected entry.

.General state diagram for BrowserPanel.
image::dg-readerview/BrowserStateDiagram.png[width="800"]

There are two conditions which cause reader view to be generated and loaded:

1. If an original web page has successfully loaded but the `reader` view mode is selected,
the reader view is generated from the currently displayed page and loaded, then the CSS stylesheet is changed.
This mechanism is used for online URLs, and was chosen because using the other mechanism below would cause a performance
bottleneck due to having to download online web pages.

.Sequence diagram for loading reader view from current page.
image::dg-readerview/ReaderViewOfPageDiagram.png[width="800"]

2. Alternatively, if the `reader` view mode is already selected and an offline URL is selected (most probably an entry),
the reader view is generated from directly reading the file pointed to by the offline URL and loaded, then the CSS stylesheet is changed.
This mechanism is used for offline URLs,
and is a performance enhancement as it bypasses waiting for the original web page to load before reader view is loaded.

.Sequence diagram for loading reader view from offline URL.
image::dg-readerview/ReaderViewOfHtmlDiagram.png[width="800"]

The Jsoup and Readability4J external libraries do the heavy lifting of parsing the raw HTML currently loaded in the `WebView` to extract useful metadata and content.
Jsoup was chosen as it is a mature HTML parser library while Readability4J was chosen as it is a port of port of Mozilla's excellent Readability.js.
These are combined into a new HTML document, which is styled using Bootstrap and then loaded in the `WebView`.

.Activity diagram for generation of reader view.
image::dg-readerview/ReaderViewGenerationActivityDiagram.png[width="400"]

As Readability4J does not extract all available and useful metadata information, Jsoup is used to manually extract author information,
as well as http://ogp.me[Open Graph metadata] like published datetime and section information if available.
As Readability4J also does not provide the estimated reading time, Jsoup is used to extract text content from the HTML DOM
Document Object, and reading time is estimated from the number of words present and the average human reading speed.

.Activity diagram for insertion of metadata element.
image::dg-readerview/InsertMetadataElementActivityDiagram.png[width="400"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: When reader view should be generated

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Generate reader view on-the-fly from the currently loaded web page.
** Pros: More flexible in the situations it can be used, will use less disk space.
** Cons: May have performance issues because it needs to be generated again every time, more difficult to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** When adding a link, generate reader view and save it to disk.
** Pros: Easier to implement, better performance as reader view is only generated only once for each link.
** Cons: Will save redundant data and use more disk space.
* **Why current choice:**
* Since users might be browsing the Internet using our application's online search features,
it is not practical to download and save every page when users are likely to be at a particular page only for a short time.
Therefore, generating reader view on-the-fly will open up reader view to our application's online search features and add value to them.

===== Aspect: How reader view styles should be specified

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Hard-code reader view styles in the app.
** Pros: Easy to implement, more control over user experience.
** Cons: Users may not like the hard-coded reader view styles.
* **Alternative 2:** Let users add custom stylesheets.
** Pros: Gives users customization options.
** Cons: Difficult to implement, stylesheets still need to be based on Bootstrap.
* **Why current choice:**
* It is a case of diminishing returns.
It is not difficult to implement a design that allows us to add a few reader view styles for users to choose from, which gives them a lot more flexibility compared to not having any styles to choose from.
However, making the design support custom user stylesheets would require much more effort while not giving users a lot more benefit.
The current design makes it very simple for us to add another reader view style, in case many users demand a particular style.
Nevertheless, this is a feature we can consider developing if there is demand for it.

// end::readerview[]

[[Feed-Support]]
// tag::feed-support[]
=== Web Feed support

To support the reading and subscription of web feeds, we decided to centralise various feed-related operations in a static class `FeedUtil`.

==== Static class (chosen approach)

We define a new static class `FeedUtil` in `commons.util`.
`FeedUtil` is primarily in charge of fetching a web feed from a URL and serializing its contents into an `EntryBook`.
The advantage of this approach, which is why we decided to use it, is because keeping all the feed handling code in a single class restricts the dependency of ROME at the program boundary, which is more maintainable.

.Activity diagram for feed fetching.
image::FeedUtilActivityDiagram.png[]

** Pros: Relatively easy to write, and we minimise the number of classes that depend on the external library.
** Cons: Increased coupling with the components that handle RSS feeds.


==== Ad-hoc

Another approach we can consider is to directly invoke ROME whenever we deal with web feeds.

** Pros: Even easier to write, almost no code needed.
** Cons: Bad cohesion, if we were to change the library for RSS parsing it requires changes in multiple components.

==== Extending and generalising Storage component.

Reading Entries from a web feed shares a major similarity with reading a stored EntryBook from disk. Both actions serialize an `EntryBook` from a source of external data.
To apply this general observation we can consider the following design.

.Class diagram illustrating more general design.
image::GeneralisedEntryBookSerializer.png[]

** Pros: Expresses the intention of the code better with a stronger separation of concerns. Also applies interface segregation principle.
** Cons: Large amounts of refactors and changes needed.

// end::feed-support[]

[[Multiple-EntryBooks]]
// tag::multiple-entrybooks[]
=== Multiple EntryBooks

ModelManager used to have only a single `EntryBook`. However, managing feeds and archives subscription system means that we need to deal with more than a single `EntryBook`.
Since we should only show a single `EntryBook` at a time, we have to make model contain multiple entrybooks.

==== Multiple EntryBooks

[[Current-ModelManager-Diagram]]
.Class diagram illustrating a model supporting multiple EntryBooks.
image::MultipleEntryBooksChosenApproach.png[width=293]

To support multiple EntryBooks, we decided to have multiple differently named EntryBooks each with their own accessors.

===== Design considerations

* *Current choice:* multiple differently named `EntryBook`’s with differently-named accessors each
** Pros: easy to implement
** Cons: accessors are basically duplicated code

.Class diagram of alternative approach for supporting multiple EntryBooks.
image::MultipleEntryBooksAlternativeApproach.png[width=399]

* *Alternative:* Each `EntryBook` belongs to a `ModelContext`,
modifiers overloaded to be context-sensitive
** Pros: less code duplication due to polymorphism
** Cons: writing to an `EntryBook` that does not belong the current state will either involve an extra accessor (basically Alternative 1), or changing state (specifically `Model#setContext`), which is not robust.

We chose to implement multiple EntryBooks in parallel as it turned out that the different EntryBooks demanded slightly different behaviour, and a more polymorphic approach like that given in the alternative might overcomplicate the implementation.

==== Decoupling displayed `EntryBook`

Another task is to decouple the `EntryBook` that is displayed from the ones that we added  to `ModelManager`.
Decoupling the displayed `EntryBook` means that the following additional methods are implemented

* `ModelManager#displayEntryBook(EntryBook)` — shows the `EntryBook` provided in the user interface.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how this mechanism behaves.

.Sequence diagram illustrating how `displayEntryBook` is used.
image::DisplayEntryBookSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

1.  The user launches the application. The `ModelManager` will default to displaying the `EntryBook` which corresponds to the default (list) context.
2.  The user executes the `feed [valid_feed_url]` command to view a web feed. The `feed` command fetches and parses the web feed into an `EntryBook` which is used for `ModelManager#setSearchEntryBook` to replace the search context `EntryBook`.
3. It then sets the `ModelContext` to `CONTEXT_SEARCH`. In the search context the `EntryBook` is read-only, and you can import links from the currently displayed `EntryBook` into the `list` context `EntryBook`.


===== Design Considerations

With reference to <<Current-ModelManager-Diagram>>, we decided to have a `SimpleListProperty<Entry>` called `displayedEntryList` which is used to provide the base list for `filteredEntries`.
The implementation of `ModelManager#displayEntryBook` will then just be a `displayedEntryList.setValue`. However we decided to keep `displayEntryBook` a private method  and not expose it via the `Model` interface.

* *Current choice:* Keep `displayEntryBook` private,
it only gets called when `ModelContext` changes.
** Pros: more defensive -- a rogue command cannot easily display junk.
** Cons: In the context of the `feed` command, where the `EntryBook` used is in fact ephemeral. When the `ModelContext` switches away from `search`, the ephemeral `EntryBook` still lives in `ModelManager`, using extra memory.
* *Alternative:* Promote `displayEntryBook` to `Model` interface so that other classes (such as various commands) could use it.
** Pros: easier implementation for some commands, slightly reduced memory usage.
** Cons: decoupling displayed `EntryBook` from `ModelContext` could allow buggy commands to place `ModelManager` in an inconsistent state.

We chose to keep `displayEntryBook` private and only invoke it on model context change since doing so is more robust and only entails a slight additional cognitive load.
// end::multiple-entrybooks[]

// tag::network-design[]
[[network-design]]
=== `Network` design

As many components have to make network calls
to retrieve resources from the Internet,
we decided to centralise it in a "singleton" class named `Network`.
The following sections describe the different design patterns we considered
and their pros and cons.

==== Design Considerations

This component is depended on by the following components:

* AddCommand (when adding articles so that they can be saved to disk)
* BrowserPanel (when viewing articles or feeds)
* Feeds management system (for fetching subscriptions, or saving feeds)

Thus, our design needs to take into consideration how it is going to be used.

Because it's possible that the settings we use to fetch resources
may need to be changed over time
(e.g. timeouts, request headers, cookies, etc.),
we should centralise the design to one component
so that these can easily be changed.
Obviously, this component should be easily accessible
from all the components listed above.
Finally, the interface for this component should be general
and apply to all use cases
because we have a large mix of possible requests:
articles, feeds, or other resources.

The only way we can make this component easily accessible is to make it global.
However, there are a couple of ways to design a global component.
The following sections describe the patterns considered.

==== Static class pattern (chosen pattern)

This pattern is to create a new class named `Network`.
This class is abstract so it cannot be instantiated,
and all its methods are marked `private`.

===== Pros

* Convenient access to the network
* Good cohesion: everything with networking details in one file
* Easy to write and subsequently modify

===== Cons

* Global variable,
  which encourages coupling with everything else in the codebase

==== Singleton pattern

This pattern is very similar to the pattern above.
We create a new class named `Network`,
and a static getter method that returns a single instance of `Network`.
This allows us the flexibility of working with objects
rather than with static methods.

===== Pros

* Convenient access to the network
* Good cohesion: everything with networking details in one file
* A little bit harder to write, as we need to include the Singleton logic,
  but still easy
* Objects allow you to perform dependency-injection,
  so the calling class can obtain the `Network` instance and pass it down
* Has the option of extending the class to possibly allowing multiple instances
  in the future

===== Cons

* More work than the static class pattern

==== Ad-hoc aka no pattern

We could also choose to directly call the network API
from whatever calling methods would have called `Network` before.
This is the simplest "pattern" as it involves not writing any code.

===== Pros

* No need to write any code
* No coupling since there's no code

===== Cons

* Bad cohesion: networking related code will be thrown all over the codebase.
  If we were to switch to using a different API
  or needing to change a particular detail in how the network API is called,
  then we would need to change them in all the places
  where the network API got called.

==== Comparison of methods and why we went with the static class pattern

Ranking the patterns from least effort to most effort,
we have ad-hoc being the easiest,
followed by static class,
and finally singleton.

Generally, the less code, the better.
This is usually the primary consideration.
This means if there are two patterns
where both meet some minimum quality standard
but one takes more effort,
we should go with the one that takes less effort to write.

We did not choose the ad-hoc pattern
because we anticipate future changes to the networking code
as we take into account more details
like timeouts, asynchronicity, cookies, etc.
In other words,
this led us to prioritise good cohesion in our desired pattern.

However, aside from this, both singleton and static class pattern
have roughly the same benefits.
We do not yet need to consider things like dependency inversion
because `Network` calls are decidedly a very global concept
which makes it less applicable.
Using the singleton pattern would have improved testability of our code,
but it would have required rewriting many of our classes
to use dependency inversion,
and this makes the code more complex.

So this is why we went with the static class pattern,
which has effectively the same benefits as singleton
after ruling out dependency inversion,
and the static class pattern is easier to write than the singleton pattern.

==== Asynchronous network calls

As the entirety of addressbook-level4 (AB4) is written synchronously,
it is a major undertaking to convert AB4 to use asynchronous (async) network calls.
We did a small scale experiment to see how async might be done by making
the `select` command download un-downloaded articles in the background.

Here is a sequence diagram showing how the interaction works:

.Sequence diagram from select command to article saving
image::SelectRefreshSdForStorage.png[width="600"]

Notice that when returning from the async network call,
we wrap our code in `Platform.runLater(...)` to ensure that the rest of the
execution is done on the JavaFX Application Thread.
This helps to prevent certain race conditions from potentially ruining the model.

However, in the process of implementing this,
we found that it made testing this unreliable
as we could no longer be sure when the command has "truly" finished executing.
Thus, we decided to defer the conversion of the rest of the AB4 to async
to the v2.0 milestone.

// end::network-design[]

// tag::offline-mode[]
=== Offline mode

Offline mode requires many changes to the architecture as a whole.
The main point of conflict is that we need to store many articles to disk
but not keep their full contents in memory.
This means the full state is no longer stored within `EntryBook` anymore.
The following sections describe
the design decisions made to support offline mode.

==== Architectural changes

===== Removing undo/redo feature

The undo/redo feature assumes that a `ReadOnlyEntryBook`
contains all the information in an `EntryBook`
and that it can be used to restore an `EntryBook` to any prior state.
However, this assumption no longer holds if we were to store articles on disk
but not keep them in memory.

Instead of modifying the design of undo/redo,
we decided to simply remove the feature as it was not a core feature
required in our user stories.

===== Moving `Storage` behind `Model`

Because we now have state that exists on the disk but not in memory,
we want to reflect this as well in the design.

State belongs in the `Model` abstraction layer,
but at the same time disk access belongs inside `Storage`.
We decided it was not wise to keep these too decoupled,
and instead we moved `Storage` under `Model`
to improve cohesion at the expense of worsening coupling.

==== Current implementation

After the architectural changes were made,
there are a few design considerations that needed to be made:

===== `Network` design

As we need to save the articles to disk,
we first need a way to obtain said articles from the Internet.
This is described in section xref:network-design[]

===== Interfacing with BrowserPanel

Currently, `Storage` provides a method that returns an Optional<Path>,
which will contain the path to the offline copy if it exists.
This is because `BrowserPanel` works by displaying URLs in a `WebView`.
Thus, by directly supplying the path,
it's better than reading the content into a String,
in case there are any encoding issues.

===== Storage model

When saving articles to disk, we need to do so in a way that performs well.
This is described in section xref:Design-Storage[]

==== Viewing an entry with offline mode

As an example, what happens when viewing an entry with offline mode enabled?
This is summarised by the activity diagram below:

.Activity diagram when viewing entry with offline mode
image::OfflineModeViewEntryActivityDiagram.png[width="600"]

// end::offline-mode[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::dataencryption[]

// end::dataencryption[]


== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

[WARNING]
Some features require a working internet connection, and as a result some tests will require internet access to pass.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyo] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all entries in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/entry/Entry.java[`Entry`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a entry, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/entry/Entry.java[`Entry`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each entry, and remove the `tag` from each entry.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last entry in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside entry cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/EntryCard.java[the `EntryCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `EntryCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.

****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a entry specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first entry to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first entry.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `EntryCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/EntryCard.java[`EntryCard`] s to display a remark for each entry later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/EntryListCard.fxml[`EntryListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/EntryCard.java[`EntryCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/EntryCardHandle.java[`EntryCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/entry/Entry.java[`Entry`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/entry/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Entry` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/entry/Entry.java[`Entry`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/entry/Entry.java[`Entry`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the entry will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `data/addressbook.json` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `JsonAdaptedEntry` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Entry` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAdaptedEntry.java[`JsonAdaptedEntry`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new JSON field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidEntryAddressBook.json`, `typicalEntriesAddressBook.json`, `validAddressBook.json` etc., such that the JSON tests will not fail due to a missing `remark` field.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `EntryBuilder`
Since `Entry` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/EntryBuilder.java[`EntryBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/entry/Entry.java[`Entry`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/EntryBuilder.java[`EntryBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the entry that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Entry` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalEntries.java[`TypicalEntries`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `EntryCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/EntryCard.java[`EntryCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/EntryCard.java[`EntryCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Entry` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysEntry(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a entry.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* has a need to manage a significant number of links
* is a heavy consumer of web content who follows many websites
* wants to download content for offline browsing because of irregular Internet access
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Target user personas*:

* Sylvia is a product manager in a Silicon Valley technology startup who often has to fly around the world for business. As an avid reader who wants to improve her work, she regularly keeps up to date with business and technology websites. With so much new content from different places everyday, she wishes she could collect them all together and focus on reading without distractions like advertisements. To be more productive on those long-haul flights, she would also like to download content to read offline.
* Sundaresh is a freelance app developer in Bangalore who consumes a lot of information on the Internet for work. The web browser bookmark manager just isn’t powerful or flexible enough for him to manage the huge number of links, and doesn’t help him follow his favourite software development blogs either. He likes doing work outside of home, but reliable free Internet access is hard to find and he doesn’t want to pay sky-high prices for mobile Internet, so he wishes he could easily download content for offline reading before leaving home.
* Joshua is a businessman in a fast-paced job environment. Always on the move, he finds himself having intermittent free time in his day traveling where he has no Internet connection. He wishes he has an offline news reader that automatically downloads news, hassle-free, from his favorite sources so he can read them on-the-go, saving his mobile data.

*Value proposition*:

Discover, curate and read more content you care about in less time (than a typical mouse/GUI driven app)
